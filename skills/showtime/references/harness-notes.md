# Harness notes: installing showtime and using it from other agent hosts

Read this when you install showtime, when you run it from an agent host other than Claude Code (or from
a script or CI), or when something about the host gets in the way: background processes are killed,
long commands time out, images cannot be viewed, there is no terminal.

## 1. Claude Code

The supported install is the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Mudassir-Kidwai/video-creator-crew
/plugin install showtime@showtime
```

The plugin ships the skill folder (`skills/showtime/`: SKILL.md, references, runtime, scripts, templates,
`bin/`); SKILL.md runs the CLI through `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/bin/showtime`, which Claude Code fills in
with the skill's folder. The plugin also registers showtime's MCP server and a progress monitor, and offers a
few settings in `/config` (default voice and language, a CPU limit, the install folder); all of it
works with the defaults and needs no setup of its own (see `mcp.md`). Tools, models and caches are not
in the plugin; the first use runs `showtime setup`, which puts them in `~/.showtime` (see
`onboarding.md`). Updating the plugin never touches `~/.showtime`; run
`showtime setup` after an update if `showtime doctor` asks for it.

For development on a clone, `showtime setup --link` links `~/.claude/skills/showtime` to the checkout
(a junction or a copy on Windows). Do not use both the link and the plugin at once.

## 2. Any other agent host

The skill is plain files plus a command-line tool, so any host that can read files and run shell
commands can use it:

1. Put the skill folder where the host looks for skills. Hosts that understand skill folders with a
   `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter `name` and `description`, Markdown body) load it as is. Otherwise add
   one line to the host's instructions: "For any video request, read `<path>/skills/showtime/SKILL.md`
   first and follow it."
2. Make `showtime` callable: add `<path>/skills/showtime/bin` to `PATH`, or call the shim by its full
   path (`bin/showtime` on macOS/Linux, `bin\showtime.cmd` on Windows, from cmd or PowerShell). If a
   checkout lost the exec bit, `python3 <path>/skills/showtime/lib/st/launcher.py <args>` does the same
   (`py -3` on Windows).
3. Run `showtime setup` once, then `showtime doctor`.
4. Optional: hosts that speak MCP can use showtime's MCP server instead of (or next to) the shell;
   `mcp.md` has the config for Claude Desktop, Cursor and Codex.

Everything showtime needs lives under `~/.showtime` (`SHOWTIME_HOME` moves it); several hosts or
checkouts can share one install.

## 3. Host behaviour that matters

| Host trait | What to do |
|---|---|
| Commands time out after a few minutes | Run long work (setup, final renders, long transcriptions, library fetch) in the background and poll; renders print progress with an ETA. Draft first: `showtime render <p> --preview` is quick |
| Background processes are killed at the end of a turn | Preview and studio servers: `showtime preview <p> --foreground` or `showtime studio serve <job>` under the host's own background mechanism |
| No terminal (piped output) | Colour and redrawn progress lines switch off by themselves; `SHOWTIME_PROGRESS=json` gives one JSON object per progress update, `off` silences it |
| Needs machine-readable output | Most commands take `--json`; errors go to stderr as `error:` / `why:` / `fix:` lines with a non-zero exit code |
| Cannot view images | The "look at it" gates in SKILL.md still apply: rely on `showtime qa` and `showtime check` text findings, and tell the user you could not inspect the frames yourself |
| No sub-agents | Skip parallel scene authoring; for publish-bound work give the user the `review-pack` folder instead of a critic sub-agent |
| Sandboxed network | Setup and `audio lib fetch` need HTTPS to their download hosts; a few extras fetch a model the first time they are used (aligner, Piper voices, rembg). Media search queries public archives and site capture fetches the pages you point it at; nothing is uploaded. `SHOWTIME_OFFLINE=1` turns off every download (fonts, voices, media search); a feature that would need one says so instead |
| Windows | Use the `.cmd` shim from cmd and from PowerShell (in PowerShell, call a quoted path with `&`: `& "<path>\bin\showtime.cmd" doctor`); it needs no execution-policy change. `showtime.ps1` runs only where the policy allows local scripts (for example `RemoteSigned`); if PowerShell answers "running scripts is disabled", type `showtime.cmd` instead of `showtime`. Paths with spaces and parentheses work |

Exit codes worth handling: `0` ok; `1` a failure the command explains (qa FAIL, check errors); `3` a
missing extra (prints the `showtime setup --with` line) or, for `showtime site capture`, a bot wall
(see `capture.md`).

## 4. Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SHOWTIME_HOME` | install location (default `~/.showtime`) |
| `SHOWTIME_OUT` | where `showtime-out/` job folders are created (default: the current folder) |
| `SHOWTIME_OFFLINE=1` | never download |
| `SHOWTIME_AUTO_INSTALL=1` | install a missing extra instead of stopping with exit code 3 |
| `SHOWTIME_PROGRESS=json\|off` | progress format when not on a terminal |
| `NO_COLOR=1` | plain text output |
| `SHOWTIME_FFMPEG`, `SHOWTIME_CHROME`, `SHOWTIME_NODE`, `SHOWTIME_PYTHON` | use your own binaries |
| `SHOWTIME_STUDIO_IDLE_MIN` | studio server idle timeout (default 240 minutes) |
| `SHOWTIME_TTS_CACHE_MB` | voice cache cap (default 1024 MB) |
| `SHOWTIME_VOICE`, `SHOWTIME_LANG` | default narration voice and language (the plugin settings set them too) |
| `SHOWTIME_MAX_WORKERS` | cap on parallel render browsers (and, unless `SHOWTIME_THREADS` is set, CPU threads) |
| `SHOWTIME_OPEN_BROWSER=1` | `showtime studio open` opens the board in the browser |
| `SHOWTIME_SOUND=1` | play a short sound logo when a command that ran over 20 s finishes (your own terminal only) |
| `SHOWTIME_SETTINGS` | location of the saved plugin settings (default `~/.showtime/plugin-settings.json`) |
| `SHOWTIME_PROGRESS_LOG=0` | do not append milestones to `~/.showtime/logs/progress.jsonl` (used by the progress monitor) |

At a terminal of your own, showtime adds three small touches: the brand mark above `showtime --help`,
`setup` and `doctor`; a completion card after `render`, `export html`, `manim render`, `edit render` and
`deliver exports` (what was made, its length, size and qa verdict when one is recorded, and the next
command); and, only with `SHOWTIME_SOUND=1` or the plugin's `sound` option, a short sound after a job longer
than 20 s (played with `afplay`, PowerShell, `paplay`/`pw-play`/`aplay` or `ffplay`; a missing player is
silently skipped). None of it appears when the output is not a terminal (Claude's tool calls, pipes, logs),
with `--json`, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, `CI` or `SHOWTIME_COLOR=never`, so scripts and parsers see the same
plain output as before.

## 5. Scripts and CI

The CLI is the whole interface; nothing needs an agent. A minimal non-interactive render:

```bash
showtime setup --tier minimal
showtime new dom demo --duration 2 --width 640 --height 360
showtime render demo -o out/final.mp4
showtime qa out/final.mp4 --json
```

`showtime clean` asks you to type the folder name before removing anything; in scripts pass `--yes`
(and `--dry-run` first to see what goes).
